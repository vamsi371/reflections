How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped very well instead of going through all the code, instead of saving a previous version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It definitely helps me in viewing my history to evaluate the changes I have done to my code throughout the time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros
    It gives us freedom to choose when to commit thereby omitting which is not important 
    cons
    when others access our code they may need something to be commited which we did not, where as in google docs it commits every change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that git can change multiple files based on the change in one file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log is used to view the history and diff is used to compare the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I'm pretty confident that git makes it very easy to help me in finding the change of code which broke something
    
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try it in my app development
